In this project, i worked on the construction of a simulation and disease in a certain region. From the information received from an INPUT.TXT, the algorithm identifies those affected, the possibilities of others being affected and also the risks of death that each entity has.
Dead entities are also contagious for a set time. There are conditions for an entity to be contagious or immune, the algorithm considers all possibilities and presents an effective result.

In this Shopping List Planner, our algorithm allows the user to enter, edit or remove the shopping list. Its behavior is similar to Google Keep Application.
When creating a list, you can:
introduce a series of products;
Mark the product as purchased (You can also uncheck it);
Each product must have a name and quantity;
You can create more than one list at the same time (not yet added in this version);

The User will control the system by entering numbers between 1-9.
